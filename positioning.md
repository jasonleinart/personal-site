# Site Positioning & Content Architecture

**Core positioning:** Domain expertise demonstrated through implementation. Platform knowledge signaling enterprise readiness. Content that attracts hiring managers and clients, not just fellow practitioners.

---

## Content Architecture

Three content types work together to demonstrate competence for AI transformation roles.

### Analysis → Strategic Landscape

**Purpose:** "I understand the domain deeply"

**What belongs here:**
- Domain research synthesis (Legal AI, Finance AI, Healthcare AI)
- Market/industry analysis with strategic implications
- Organizational transformation frameworks
- 30,000 ft architecture decisions (not implementation details)

**What doesn't belong:**
- Code snippets or configuration details
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Tool-specific tutorials

**Hiring signal:** AI Strategy & Advisory, Executive Communication

### Projects → Technical Proof

**Purpose:** "I can actually build this"

**What belongs here:**
- Working implementations with outcomes
- Architecture decisions with rationale
- Technical READMEs with implementation details
- Demo applications that prove feasibility

**What doesn't belong:**
- Pure strategy without implementation
- Theoretical frameworks without proof points

**Hiring signal:** PoC Development, Technical Credibility

### Notes → Continuous Engagement

**Purpose:** "I'm in the weeds on the details"

**What belongs here:**
- Specific insights pulled from analysis or projects
- Implementation learnings ("Why hybrid search matters for legal text")
- Observations that don't warrant full articles
- Links back to related analysis or projects

**What doesn't belong:**
- Full strategic analysis (goes in Analysis)
- Complete project documentation (goes in Projects)

**Hiring signal:** Thought Leadership, Depth of Understanding

## Content Relationship Pattern

For each domain (Legal AI, Finance AI, etc.), the content flows:

```
Analysis: "Legal AI Roadmap"
├── Strategic landscape
├── Architecture decisions at 30,000 ft
├── Organizational implications
└── Links to → Project

Project: "/contract-review-demo"
├── Working implementation
├── Technical README with:
│   ├── Configuration choices
│   ├── Evaluation metrics
│   └── Trade-off rationale
└── Links back to → Analysis

Notes: (2-3 pieces)
├── "Why hybrid search matters for legal text"
├── "The citation verification problem"
└── Links to both Analysis and Project
```

**This architecture tells hiring managers:**
- Analysis → "Thinks strategically about AI in [domain]"
- Project → "Can actually build it"
- Notes → "Engages continuously with details"

## Target Audience

**Why the shift:** The JPM signal (January 2026) clarified enterprise reality:
- Enterprises don't want AI-native transformation. They want vendor AI adoption.
- Platform expertise matters more than building skills for consulting.
- Change management and adoption are the real constraints, not AI capability.
- The "bubble-up" theory has limits. Personal AI mastery is necessary but not sufficient.

The target audience—Big 4 consultants, Fortune 1000 hiring managers, mid-market executives—isn't looking for someone on a journey. They're looking for someone who can guide *their* journey.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Hiring managers and decision-makers for AI transformation roles

| Persona | What They're Looking For | What Signals Value |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Big 4 Partner/Manager** | Platform certs, domain expertise, client-facing ability | Case studies, certifications, executive communication |
| **Fortune 1000 AI Manager** | Vendor ecosystem knowledge, adoption experience | Copilot/Einstein fluency, change management evidence |
| **Mid-market Executive** | Fast time-to-value, practical solutions | "I built X for Y, resulted in Z" stories |

**Secondary:** Peers and network (other practitioners, consultants, analysts)

| Persona | What They're Looking For | What Signals Value |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Enterprise architects** | Technical depth, platform understanding | Integration architecture, cloud service knowledge |
| **AI/ML practitioners** | Credible technical foundation | Implementation details, honest trade-off analysis |
| **Industry analysts** | Domain insights, trend validation | Research synthesis, data-backed perspectives |

### Fortune 1000 AI Transformation Manager (Peer-Level Target)
**What they're actually looking for:**
- Vendor ecosystem knowledge (M365 + Copilot, Salesforce + Einstein)
- Adoption playbooks with metrics
- Stakeholder management experience
- Evidence of driving organizational change

### Mid-Market CEO/COO (Services Target)
**What they're actually looking for:**
- "I did X for a company like yours, resulted in Y"
- Fast time-to-value
- Specific industry understanding
- Technical capability without needing to hire a team
## The Strategic Pivot

**Don't abandon AI-native identity. Demonstrate it through domain-relevant implementation rather than explain it through frameworks.**

| Current Approach | Recommended Approach |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "Here's what AI-native means" (framework) | "Here's what I built for a retail client" (proof) |
| "Three Horizons explain transformation" (theory) | "Here's how I helped a team adopt Copilot" (story) |
| "Capability loading is real" (concept) | "I loaded manufacturing scheduling optimization" (evidence) |
| "I'm on a journey" (process) | "I solved this problem" (outcome) |

**Problems I Think About:**
- Why enterprise AI adoption stalls at vendor integration
- The trust-building progression from analytics to automation
- How regulatory burden shapes deployment timelines across industries
- The gap between vendor AI promises and implementation reality
- How mid-market can access enterprise-grade AI at accessible cost

## Quick Reference: Language

**Use:**
- "I solved X for a company like yours"
- "Here's what the research says about [domain]"
- "Built and deployed"
- "Drove adoption across [scope]"
- "Platform architecture on AWS/Azure"

## The Value Proposition

**For enterprise/consulting roles:**

> "I bridge domain research and practical implementation. I understand what the academic literature says about AI in manufacturing, retail, finance, healthcare, and legal. I understand what enterprise platforms (AWS, Azure) actually offer. And I can build enough to demonstrate feasibility without needing a dev team."

**The differentiator:** Research depth + platform knowledge + technical execution capability. Not an AI researcher. Not a developer. Not a pure strategist. The intersection.

**Proof points:**
- 6 domain case studies processed (Finance, Healthcare, Legal, Retail, Manufacturing x2)
- AWS SAA + Azure AI certifications in progress
- Production implementations: lead scoring system, client sites, knowledge management architecture
- Transformation playbook synthesized from 5+ primary sources

### Build: Three Content Pillars

**Pillar 1: Domain Case Studies (60% of content)**

| Domain | Content Angle |
|--------|---------------|
| Retail | "ML in retail: What Walmart and IKEA figured out that mid-market can't afford to ignore" |
| Manufacturing | "The trust-building progression: Why you can't sell automation to skeptical plant managers" |
| Finance | "Why JPMorgan laughs off in-housing software (and what that means for AI transformation)" |
| Healthcare | "Why healthcare AI is 90-365 days to deploy while retail is 60-90" |

Format: Research breakdown posts, comparison insights, "here's what the data says" authority.

Why it works: Demonstrates domain expertise. Shows you understand enterprise reality. Creates content that enterprise people actually search for and share.

**Pillar 2: Platform/Tool Deep Dives (25% of content)**

| Topic | Content Angle |
|-------|---------------|
| AWS Bedrock vs Azure AI Foundry | "Where Claude lives in the enterprise: Bedrock explained" |
| Cloud service models | "IaaS, PaaS, SaaS: Why this matters for your AI strategy" |
| Copilot adoption | "What the JPM signal tells us about Copilot" |

Format: Platform explainers, certification study insights, "here's what I learned" with practical application.

Why it works: Signals platform expertise. Shows you're investing in enterprise-relevant skills.

**Pillar 3: Implementation Stories (15% of content)**

| Story | Wrong Frame | Right Frame |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Lead scoring system | "Capability loading worked for me" | "I built a lead scoring system that processes 20K+ subscribers. Here's what I learned about data quality requirements." |
| Client websites | "I'm not a developer anymore" | "I delivered 3 production sites with near-perfect technical SEO. The implementation pattern is repeatable." |
| Knowledge system | "I built personal infrastructure" | "I systematized research analysis across 6 industry domains. Here's the architecture." |

Format: Outcome-first, technical details, transferable insight.

Why it works: Proves you can execute. Shows technical depth without claiming developer identity. Creates "show me" evidence.
