A specific subset of AI transformation involves encoding proprietary expertise into a scalable agent. McKinsey, MECLABS, and MinistryAI all faced this problem but arrived at vastly different architectures based on two critical filters: Intent and Implementation.

## The Core Problem

All three needed to turn accumulated knowledge into scalable AI capability.

| Organization | Expertise to Encode |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **McKinsey** | 100,000+ case studies, consulting frameworks |
| **MECLABS** | 10,000+ marketing experiments, conversion methodology |
| **MinistryAI** | 40 years ministry experience, church growth patterns |

Same problem. Different filters led to different architectures.

## The Intent Filter: Cost Center vs. Revenue Center

Before a single line of code is written, the financial role of the agent dictates the design.

| Strategy | Cost Center (McKinsey) | Revenue Center (MECLABS) |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Primary Goal** | Operational efficiency (internal) | Market growth (external) |
| **Success Metric** | Productivity gains & time saved | Subscriptions & partner contracts |
| **Data Handling** | Proprietary and client-confidential | Methodology as the public product |
| **Access** | Internal consultants (Lilli) | External customers & ecosystem |

Both built their systems. But the intent filter shaped every downstream decision.

## The Implementation: Build vs. Buy Platform

Engineering capability shouldn't be the bottleneck for domain experts. MinistryAI (Bill Giovannetti) serves as the playbook for this path.

**The Decision:** Bill didn't build RAG infrastructure from scratch. He bought the MECLABS platform as his infrastructure and built his specific ministry expertise on top.

**The Moat:** The 40 years of ministry knowledge—experience growing a church from 790 to 5,000 members. The AI infrastructure is commodity.

**Velocity as a Moat:** This allowed a non-engineer to go from idea to the official AI platform for The Christian & Missionary Alliance (1,900+ churches) in months, not years.

## The Strategic Matrix

| | Internal (Cost Center) | External (Revenue Center) |
|---|---|---|
| **Build** | McKinsey (Lilli) | MECLABS (Platform) |
| **Buy + Build Vertical** | — | MinistryAI |
| **Buy SaaS** | Most enterprises | Small businesses |

## Strategic Implications

**The moat is the methodology.** The value is never the LLM or the RAG pipeline. It's the 40 years of ministry knowledge or the 10,000+ marketing experiments being encoded.

**Architecture follows finance.** If you are building a revenue center, you cannot use a cost-center architecture. The intent filter must come first.

**Velocity vs. control.** Buying the "rails" (platform) allows the domain expert to focus 100% of their energy on the expertise layer—the only part that actually differentiates the product.
