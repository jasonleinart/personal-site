Most AI transformations fail because they never reach critical mass.

The research is clear: transformations that achieve 7% employee *ownership* (not just participation) are twice as likely to exceed sector returns. The current average? Just 2%.

The distinction matters. Participation is attending the training. Ownership is being accountable for a milestone's delivery.

This is why broad tool rollouts often fail—they create users, not owners. The 7% threshold requires giving people real stakes in specific outcomes, not just access to new software.

If you're leading a transformation, count your owners, not your users.
