description: "Everyone assumes AI adoption stalls because the technology is expensive. Across multiple studies, technology cost is the least-cited barrier at 11%. The real blockers are organizational."

Ask any executive why their AI initiative stalled and they'll reach for a familiar excuse: the technology is too expensive, too complex, not ready yet.

The data tells a different story.

A survey of 200+ companies by the Digital Poland Foundation found that technology cost ranked dead last among barriers to AI adoption. Only 11% of AI teams cited it as a blocker. The actual top barriers:

| Barrier | % Citing |
|---------|----------|
| Investment willingness | 40% |
| Data quality costs | 53% |
| Management misunderstanding of AI benefits | 35% |
| Readiness to finance AI projects | 48% |
| Technology cost | 11% |

The tools aren't the problem. The organization is.

## Where This Shows Up

LPP, Poland's largest clothing retailer, built serious AI infrastructure: Google Cloud migration, centralized data lakes, K2Bots.AI chatbots that resolve 70% of customer cases, warehouse AI that shortened picking routes by 30%. Real capability, real results.

But only 22% of marketing and PR departments across Polish companies used any AI tools at all. LPP built the plumbing. Most of the building never turned on the faucets.

This pattern repeats across contexts. MIT's George Westerman found that [95% of enterprise GenAI projects show no measurable returns within six months](/notes/westerman-risk-slope). Consulting practitioners report that "the most sophisticated AI system that nobody uses is worth $0." One in three employees admits to actively sabotaging company AI rollouts.

## The Communication Failure

The 40% "willingness to invest" figure deserves unpacking. It's not that budgets don't exist. It's that nobody made the case in language leadership understands.

LPP measured chatbot resolution rates and warehouse efficiency. Operations metrics. Nobody translated those gains into customer lifetime value, acquisition cost reduction, or competitive positioning. The strategic value went unmeasured, and unmeasured value doesn't get funded.

This is the real gap. Not between AI capability and business need, but between what practitioners can demonstrate and what management needs to hear before writing the check.

## The Implication

If you're leading an AI initiative, stop optimizing for the 11% problem (technology selection and cost) and start addressing the 40% problem (organizational willingness). That means:

- Measuring business outcomes, not tool performance
- Translating operational wins into financial language
- Running readiness assessments before tool evaluations

The [7% tipping point](/notes/seven-percent-tipping-point) applies here too. You don't need the whole organization on board. You need enough owners, speaking the right language, to shift the default from skepticism to investment.
