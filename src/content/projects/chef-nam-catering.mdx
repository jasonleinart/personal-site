title: "Chef Nam Catering Website"
role: "Builder"
year: 2025
duration: "3 weeks"
teamSize: 1
outcomeSummary: "Custom website built with modern stack—100% coded with Claude, zero prior HTML/CSS knowledge"
overview: "Built a complete custom website for a local catering business using Astro and Sanity CMS, entirely through AI-collaborative development"
problem: "Client needed a professional website to showcase their catering services. Template solutions didn't capture the brand personality, and I had no frontend development experience—didn't know HTML or CSS."
constraints:
  - "No HTML/CSS knowledge at project start"
  - "Client needed full content control (CMS required)"
  - "Performance-critical for local SEO"
  - "Budget-conscious—couldn't justify traditional agency costs"
approach: "Treated this as a test of AI-collaborative development for unfamiliar domains. Used Claude Code as my development partner—not to generate code blindly, but to work through architecture decisions, debug layout issues, and understand what I was building. Learned to work with my machine differently: command line, local files, deployment pipelines."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "Build custom with Astro rather than use WordPress or Squarespace"
    reasoning: "Modern stack = better performance = better SEO. Full control over design and functionality. Learning investment pays forward to future projects."
    alternatives:
      - "WordPress with premium theme"
      - "Squarespace or Wix"
      - "Hire a web developer"
  - decision: "Use Sanity CMS for content management"
    reasoning: "Headless CMS gives client full control over content without touching code. Generous free tier. Excellent developer experience for building custom schemas."
    alternatives:
      - "Markdown files (no CMS)"
      - "WordPress as headless CMS"
      - "Contentful"
  - decision: "Deploy on Cloudflare Pages"
    reasoning: "Free tier handles traffic easily. Global CDN for fast load times. Simple deployment from Git. Already using Cloudflare for DNS."
    alternatives:
      - "Netlify"
      - "Vercel"
      - "Traditional hosting"
techStack:
  - "Astro"
  - "Sanity CMS"
  - "Tailwind CSS"
  - "Cloudflare Pages"
  - "Claude Code"
impact:
  metrics:
    - label: "Lighthouse Score"
      value: "Near-perfect technical SEO"
    - label: "Time to Build"
      value: "3 weeks from zero knowledge"
    - label: "Ongoing Cost"
      value: "$0/month (free tier)"
  qualitative: "Client has full control over content. Site loads fast, ranks well locally. Proved that AI collaboration can bridge significant skill gaps—not by replacing learning, but by accelerating it."
learnings:
  - "The 'how do I deploy this?' friction is where most side projects die. Claude helped me push through."
  - "Three sites later, I'm not a frontend developer—but I'm no longer someone who outsources anything technical"
  - "Working with AI on unfamiliar domains requires learning to ask better questions, not just accepting answers"

## The Skill Acquisition Pattern

This project revealed a pattern I've seen repeat across domains:

**Capability loading** (AI gives you access to skills) is the easy part.

**Sparring** (working through problems, building judgment) is where actual learning happens.

I could have asked Claude to generate an entire website. Instead, I used it to understand what I was building—why this CSS property does that, why this component structure makes sense, how deployment actually works.

The result: I can now build and maintain websites. Not because AI did it for me, but because AI collaboration accelerated the learning I needed to do anyway.
