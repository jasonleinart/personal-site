title: "Choosing 'Learning in Public' as a Career Strategy"
date: 2026-01-15
context: "After being laid off, the conventional approach was to quietly job hunt—update resume, apply to roles, network privately. Instead, I chose to build and share publicly while searching. This was a deliberate strategic decision, not just a coping mechanism."
decision: "Build in public, write about what I'm learning, and let the work create opportunities rather than chasing them directly"
alternatives:
  - option: "Traditional job search (quiet mode)"
    pros:
      - "Lower risk—no public failures"
      - "More time for applications and interviews"
      - "No pressure to produce content"
    cons:
      - "Competing on resume alone"
      - "No differentiation from other candidates"
      - "Network stays static"
  - option: "Learning in public"
    pros:
      - "Work becomes visible proof of capability"
      - "Attracts opportunities that fit my actual skills"
      - "Builds network through shared interests"
      - "Content compounds—today's post is tomorrow's credibility"
    cons:
      - "Takes time away from direct applications"
      - "Public failures are visible"
      - "Requires consistency and discipline"
  - option: "Start a consulting business immediately"
    pros:
      - "Income potential"
      - "Control over work"
    cons:
      - "Requires existing client pipeline"
      - "Distraction from building long-term positioning"
reasoning: "The job market for generic 'digital marketing managers' is crowded. But the market for people who can actually implement AI systems and think strategically about it? Much smaller. Learning in public lets me demonstrate capability rather than just claim it. The LinkedIn bio update alone generated an interview with an AI company and a speaking invitation—with no content yet, just positioning. Imagine what consistent output could do."

## The Positioning Shift

Before: "Digital Marketing Manager with 10+ years experience"

After: "AI practitioner building systems, documenting decisions, sharing what works"

Same person. Same skills. Completely different response from the market.

## Why This Works

1. **Proof over claims**: Anyone can say they understand AI. Few people can show a production system they built.

2. **Attraction over pursuit**: Instead of convincing companies I'm worth interviewing, the work attracts people who already value what I do.

3. **Compound returns**: Every post, every project, every decision documented—it all builds on itself. A year from now, I'll have a body of work that speaks for itself.

## The Risk I'm Taking

Public learning means public failures. Not every post will land. Not every project will work. But the alternative—staying invisible while hoping the right opportunity finds me—feels riskier.

## Early Signals

Within weeks of updating my LinkedIn positioning (before any content):
- Interview with an AI company
- Speaking invitation from PMI Great Lakes Chapter

The positioning alone changed how people saw me. The content will amplify it.
