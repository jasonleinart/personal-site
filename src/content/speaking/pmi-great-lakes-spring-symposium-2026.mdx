The project management profession is at an inflection point. AI tools have moved beyond simple task automation into territory that challenges fundamental PM assumptions about planning, risk assessment, and resource allocation.

This session explores the practical realities of AI-native project management: what's actually working, where organizations get stuck, and how PMs can position themselves for a landscape where AI handles execution while humans focus on strategy, stakeholder alignment, and navigating ambiguity.

Key takeaways:
- The maturity curve from AI-assisted to AI-native PM workflows
- Where autonomous agents add value vs. where human judgment remains critical
- Building organizational readiness for AI adoption (the change management nobody talks about)
- Frameworks for evaluating which PM tasks to automate first
