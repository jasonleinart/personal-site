The AI discourse often conflates two very different approaches: **agents** (AI systems that reason and make decisions) and **automation** (rules-based systems that execute predefined logic).

Both are valuable. Neither is universally better. The question is: when does each fit?

## The Core Distinction

**Automation** works when:
- The problem is well-defined
- The inputs and outputs are predictable
- The logic can be codified as rules
- Consistency matters more than adaptability

**AI Agents** work when:
- The problem requires interpretation
- Inputs are unstructured or variable
- The "right answer" depends on context
- Adaptability matters more than consistency

## A Decision Framework

Ask these questions:

1. **Can I write explicit rules for this?**
   - Yes → Automation is likely sufficient
   - No → Consider an agent

2. **Does this require understanding natural language or unstructured data?**
   - Yes → Agent territory
   - No → Automation might work

3. **How important is consistency vs. adaptability?**
   - Consistency critical → Automation (agents can be unpredictable)
   - Adaptability critical → Agent (automation is rigid)

4. **What happens when the task fails?**
   - Failures are costly → Start with automation (more predictable)
   - Failures are acceptable learning → Agent experimentation is fine

## Practical Examples

**Use Automation:**
- Moving data between systems on a schedule
- Sending templated notifications based on triggers
- Validating form inputs against rules
- Routing tickets based on keywords

**Use Agents:**
- Analyzing customer feedback for themes
- Drafting responses that require context understanding
- Researching topics across multiple sources
- Making recommendations based on nuanced criteria

## The Hybrid Approach

The most effective systems often combine both:

1. **Automation as the backbone**: Handle predictable, rules-based tasks
2. **Agents at decision points**: Intervene where interpretation is needed
3. **Human oversight**: Review agent outputs for high-stakes decisions

This isn't either/or—it's knowing where each tool fits.

## The Meta-Lesson

The hype cycle pushes toward "agents for everything." But agents are expensive (compute and tokens), unpredictable (outputs vary), and overkill for many tasks.

Good systems design asks: *What's the simplest approach that solves this problem?*

Sometimes that's an agent. Often it's not.
