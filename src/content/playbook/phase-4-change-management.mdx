## Governance Lens

The AI Governance Framework treats change management as a risk category, not a nice-to-have. Failed adoption is a write-off of everything you invested in discovery, assessment, and architecture.

I've watched technically excellent systems fail because nobody thought about the humans who had to use them. A $2M contract analysis platform sat unused for 14 months because the attorneys didn't trust it and nobody addressed their concerns. The technology worked. The change management didn't exist.

| Risk Category | What Goes Wrong | Prevention |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Adoption failure** | Users ignore or work around the system | Champion networks and phased rollout |
| **Shadow processes** | Old workflows persist alongside new ones | Clear cutover and process retirement |
| **Skill degradation** | Users never develop fluency | Reinforcement training, not one-and-done |
| **Trust erosion** | Early problems poison long-term perception | Managed expectations and quick wins |

The governance framework requires documented adoption metrics before declaring a project successful. Deployment isn't done when the system goes live. It's done when people actually use it.

## The Methodology

### Stakeholder Mapping

Before any rollout, I need to know who's who.

The Stakeholder Assessment maps people across two dimensions: **influence** (can they block or accelerate adoption?) and **disposition** (are they for, against, or undecided?).

| Disposition | High Influence | Low Influence |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Champion** | Executive sponsor, visible early adopter | Enthusiastic user, informal advocate |
| **Fence-sitter** | Key decision-maker watching outcomes | Majority of users waiting to see |
| **Blocker** | Vocal opponent with organizational power | Skeptic who can poison team sentiment |

This mapping changes strategy. A high-influence champion gets recruited for visible endorsement. A high-influence blocker gets one-on-one attention to surface real concerns. A low-influence fence-sitter just needs to see their peers succeeding.

Energy spent trying to convert a committed blocker is usually wasted. Focus on fence-sitters. Move enough of them and blockers become isolated.

### Resistance Diagnosis

Not all resistance is the same. The Fear & Resistance Diagnostic distinguishes four root causes:

**Job security fear** — "Will this replace me?"

This requires reassurance about role evolution, not just training on the tool. Show them what the job looks like with AI assistance, not instead of them. One legal ops team's resistance evaporated when they realized the AI handled the tedious clause extraction they hated, freeing them for the negotiation work they actually enjoyed.

**Skill gap anxiety** — "I won't be able to learn this."

This requires graduated training with early wins. Start with the simplest use case. Build confidence before complexity. A 62-year-old paralegal who initially refused to touch the system became its biggest advocate after a patient 30-minute session showed her it was easier than the software she already used.

**Workflow disruption** — "This breaks how I work."

This requires process co-design, not just announcements. Involve users in defining how the tool fits their workflow. Imposed processes breed resentment. Collaborative processes breed ownership.

**Trust deficit** — "I don't believe it works."

This requires proof, not promises. Pilot results. Error rate comparisons. Testimonials from respected peers. One manufacturing team didn't believe the predictive maintenance model until a senior operator they all respected said it caught a failure he would have missed.

### Champion Networks

Champions sell adoption better than any training program. The Champion Network Planner identifies, recruits, and activates peer influencers.

A good champion has three characteristics:

1. **Credibility** — Peers respect their judgment
2. **Willingness** — They'll actually advocate, not just agree
3. **Access** — They interact with the people you're trying to reach

I aim for one champion per 10-15 target users. They don't need to be experts—they need to be trusted voices who can say "I was skeptical too, but this actually helps."

Activation matters more than recruitment. A champion who agreed to help but never actually advocates is worse than useless—they're a false positive that makes you think you have coverage you don't.

### Training for Retention

Most corporate training fails. Studies show 90% forgetting within a week for one-time sessions. The 30/60/90 Training Plan designs for retention, not completion.

**First 30 days** — Basic competency. Can they perform the core workflow? Measure task completion, not just attendance.

**Days 30-60** — Fluency. Can they handle variations and exceptions? Measure speed and error rates.

**Days 60-90** — Mastery. Can they troubleshoot problems and help others? Measure peer support and edge case handling.

Each phase has reinforcement built in: follow-up sessions, office hours, quick reference materials, peer check-ins. The goal is behavior change, not checkbox completion.

## Communication Sequencing

Poor communication sinks adoption. Too much information overwhelms. Too little creates anxiety. Bad timing breeds rumors.

The Communication Calendar sequences messaging across three phases:

**Awareness** (weeks before launch) — What's coming and why. Focus on the problem being solved, not the solution details. Address the "why should I care" question before the "how does it work" question.

**Understanding** (days before launch) — How it works and what changes. Specific enough to reduce anxiety, not so detailed it overwhelms. This is where training gets scheduled and expectations get set.

**Adoption** (launch and after) — Reinforcement and troubleshooting. Celebrate early wins visibly. Address problems quickly before they become narratives. Keep momentum through the inevitable rough patches.

The biggest communication mistake is going dark after launch. Early adopters need validation. Fence-sitters need evidence. Problems need acknowledgment. Silence after launch tells everyone the project is abandoned.

## Common Mistakes

**Treating training as the change management strategy.** Training is one component. Without stakeholder alignment, resistance diagnosis, and communication planning, training alone won't drive adoption. I've seen organizations pour resources into elaborate training programs while ignoring the blockers actively undermining the rollout.

**Ignoring the middle.** High-influence stakeholders get attention. Loud resisters get attention. The quiet majority in the middle gets ignored—and they're the ones who determine whether adoption reaches critical mass or stalls at 20%.

**One-and-done training.** A single training session feels efficient. It's actually waste. Build reinforcement into the plan or watch skills evaporate within weeks.

**Promising too much.** Overselling the technology creates a trust deficit when reality doesn't match expectations. Users who feel deceived become blockers. Set realistic expectations and let the tool exceed them.

**Declaring victory at launch.** Deployment is not adoption. The work continues until usage metrics show the tool is actually embedded in workflows, not just available.
