## Why Now

I'd worked on plenty of "agile" projects. Standups, sprints, retrospectives—the ceremonies were familiar.

But I realized I was doing agile without understanding agile. Following rituals without grasping the principles behind them.

## The Learning

The certification forced me to slow down and understand:

- **Why** sprints work (timeboxing creates focus and feedback loops)
- **When** agile fits vs. when it doesn't (uncertainty vs. predictability)
- **How** to adapt frameworks to context (not dogmatic about any single approach)

## What Stuck

The biggest insight: agile isn't about the process. It's about feedback loops and adaptation.

That principle applies everywhere—not just software development. AI projects. Content strategy. Career decisions.

## Connection to AI Work

AI implementation is inherently uncertain. Requirements shift as capabilities become clear. What seemed impossible last month is suddenly feasible.

Agile thinking—small iterations, fast feedback, continuous adaptation—is how you navigate that uncertainty.

The certification gave me language and frameworks to think about this more rigorously.
