# Target Audience

Who reads the site, what they're looking for, and how to signal value to them.

## The Reality Check

**Why this framing matters:** The JPM signal (January 2026) clarified enterprise reality:

- Enterprises don't want AI-native transformation. They want vendor AI adoption.
- Platform expertise matters more than building skills for consulting.
- Change management and adoption are the real constraints, not AI capability.
- The "bubble-up" theory has limits. Personal AI mastery is necessary but not sufficient.

The target audience—Big 4 consultants, Fortune 1000 hiring managers, mid-market executives—isn't looking for someone on a journey. They're looking for someone who can guide *their* journey.

## Target Role Clusters

The site targets three overlapping role types:

| Cluster | Example Roles | What They Want | Site Signal |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **AI Enablement** | KPMG AI Initiatives, Ford AI Integrations, AI Enablement Coach | Change management, adoption, training, governance | Playbook + Notes |
| **CRM/MarTech Strategy** | Deloitte CRM Strategist, Marketing Technology PM | Journey orchestration, personalization, multi-channel | Projects (CRM) |
| **Technical Program Management** | Ford Manager AI Integrations (hybrid) | PoC development, build vs buy, business cases | Projects (AI) + Analysis |

**Common thread across all clusters:** Change management. Every target role emphasizes getting organizations to adopt technology, not just building it. The technical bar is "can build PoCs and evaluate solutions"—not "AI engineer."
