## Career Arc

**The evolution:** Marketing Director → Systems Architecture → AI-Native Operations

A systems architect disguised as a marketer, transitioning into AI-native operations.

### Phase 1: Brand & Community (2015-2020)

**Detroit Optimist Society** — Marketing Director

Built digital presence across 7 brands (180K combined followers). Revenue generation through community: Whiskey Society Facebook group → $30K annually. Website redesigns → $60K annual improvements.

*What I learned:* How communities form around shared identity. How systems of engagement translate to measurable outcomes.

### Phase 2: Systems Architecture (2021-Present)

**31st Street Capital** — Digital Marketing & AI Systems Manager

The role evolved from marketing into systems design:

- **Data Pipeline Architecture**: Connected Go High Level CRM → BigQuery → Google Cloud Platform → Rollmaster proprietary systems
- **AI-Driven Automation**: 60% increase in booked appointments through intelligent workflow design
- **Value-Based Optimization**: Offline conversion imports, first-party data pipelines, Facebook CAPI deployment

*What I learned:* Marketing is a systems problem. The bottleneck isn't creativity—it's infrastructure, integration, and intelligent automation.

### Phase 3: AI-Native Building (Current)

**Peakscape Digital** — Founder & AI Consultant

- Email lead scoring system for client (20K+ leads, API + dashboard)
- $30K revenue in 90 days for catering client (brand, website, Google Ads)

*Where I'm going:* From marketing systems to AI-native operations—building the infrastructure that enables organizations to leverage AI at scale.

## Cross-Domain Fluency

No single domain owns the problem. Most real problems sit at intersections.

| Domain | What I Bring | When I Apply It |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Systems Thinking** | Feedback loops, emergent behavior, second-order effects | Designing workflows, diagnosing bottlenecks, architecting integrations |
| **Marketing & Behavioral Economics** | Customer psychology, incentive design, conversion optimization | GTM strategy, funnel design, value proposition development |
| **Data & Analytics** | Statistical reasoning, attribution modeling, signal vs. noise | Performance measurement, optimization decisions, ROI analysis |
| **Technology & Automation** | API architecture, workflow logic, AI/ML capabilities | Building infrastructure, evaluating tools, implementation planning |
| **Operations & Process Design** | Efficiency patterns, bottleneck theory, standardization vs. flexibility | Scaling systems, reducing manual work, ensuring consistency |
| **Strategy & Economics** | Competitive dynamics, resource allocation, opportunity cost | Prioritization, positioning, investment decisions |

**"I work the intersections."** The value is in synthesis—combining frames to see what specialists miss.

## Problem-Led Leadership

From MIT Leadership Center research—this describes how I operate:

**Anti-leadership affect**: Skepticism of positional authority divorced from competence. Leadership begins with problem identification, not personal ambition.

**T-shaped knowledge**: Deep expertise in specific domains + broad working knowledge across others. Legitimacy comes from understanding what each person brings.

**Stepping up and stepping out**: At different points, different people must lead based on their special skill. I cede control when it's time to shift focus.

**Working the problem**: "Let's work the problem, people. Let's not make things worse by guessing."

- Where's the data?
- Fail fast and iterate
- Cycling between abstract theory and practical engineering

## The Throughline

**Change management** connects everything:

- Marketing → drove adoption of new channels and tools across hospitality brands
- Systems → built infrastructure AND got 27 locations to use it
- AI → not just building models, but driving organizational adoption

The technical bar is "can build PoCs and evaluate solutions"—not "AI engineer." The real work is getting organizations to adopt technology, not just building it.

## Multi-Location Operations Pattern

This is a career pattern, not one job detail:

| Role | Domain | Scale |
|------|--------|-------|
| Marketing Director | Hospitality (bars & restaurants) | 7 locations |
| Digital Marketing & AI Systems | PE-backed retail (flooring) | 50 locations, $100M+ portfolio |

**Why this matters:**
- Ford → dealer networks are multi-location operations
- Deloitte CRM → retail and hospitality are client verticals
- Any enterprise role → franchise-like complexity, distributed team adoption
