# Site Positioning

**Core positioning:** Practitioner who's built the systems, positioned to lead adoption at scale. Technical enough to evaluate solutions and build PoCs. Strategic enough to drive organizational change.

**The differentiator:** Not an AI researcher. Not a developer. Not a pure strategist. The intersection—with change management as the throughline.

## Domain Experience (Actual, Not Researched)

**Career pattern: Multi-location operations.** This is the throughline, not a one-job detail.

| Role | Domain | Scale | Relevance |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Marketing Director | Hospitality (bars & restaurants) | 7 locations | Distributed teams, location-specific marketing |
| Operations/Marketing Leadership | PE-backed retail (flooring) | 50 locations, $100M+ portfolio | Enterprise scale, franchise-like complexity |
| Adjacent | Home services (builder business) | Service operations | Consumer-facing, field coordination |

**Why this matters for target roles:**
- **Ford** - Dealer networks are multi-location operations
- **Deloitte CRM** - Retail and hospitality are both client verticals
- **Any enterprise role** - Franchise-like complexity, location-specific personalization, distributed team adoption

**Framing principle:** Lead with the pattern ("multi-location operations across retail and hospitality"), not one job's metrics ("$100M portfolio").

**Domains researched** (from WKM case studies): Legal AI, Finance AI, Healthcare AI, Manufacturing AI, Retail ML

## Quick Reference: Language

**Use:**
- "I solved X for a company like yours"
- "Here's what the research says about [domain]"
- "Built and deployed"
- "Drove adoption across [scope]"
- "Platform architecture on AWS/Azure"

## The Value Proposition

**For enterprise/consulting roles:**

> "I bridge domain research and practical implementation. I understand what the academic literature says about AI in manufacturing, retail, finance, healthcare, and legal. I understand what enterprise platforms (AWS, Azure) actually offer. And I can build enough to demonstrate feasibility without needing a dev team."

**The differentiator:** Research depth + platform knowledge + technical execution capability. Not an AI researcher. Not a developer. Not a pure strategist. The intersection.

**Proof points:**
- 6 domain case studies processed (Finance, Healthcare, Legal, Retail, Manufacturing x2)
- AWS SAA + Azure AI certifications in progress
- Production implementations: lead scoring system, client sites, knowledge management architecture
- Transformation playbook synthesized from 5+ primary sources
- Multi-location retail transformation (50 locations, $100M portfolio)

## Platform Positioning

**Emphasize (enterprise):**
- Azure AI services (OpenAI, Document Intelligence, AI Search)
- GCP (BigQuery, Cloud Functions)
- AWS (when certified)
- M365 / Copilot ecosystem
- CRM architecture (platform-agnostic framing)

**De-emphasize (SMB-coded):**
- Go High Level by name (frame as "marketing automation architecture")
- Tool-specific tutorials
- SMB-scale examples
