## Core Positioning

**The arc:** Marketing Director → Systems Architecture → AI-Native Operations

A systems architect disguised as a marketer—transitioning into AI-native operations, bringing cross-domain fluency and problem-led leadership to organizations building their AI infrastructure.

**The differentiator:** Not an AI researcher. Not a developer. Not a pure strategist. The intersection—with change management as the throughline.

**The value:** "I work the intersections." Systems + Marketing + Data + Technology + Operations + Strategy. The value is in synthesis—combining frames to see what specialists miss.

## Value Proposition

**For enterprise/consulting roles:**

> "I bridge domain research and practical implementation. I understand what the academic literature says about AI in manufacturing, retail, finance, healthcare, and legal. I understand what enterprise platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) actually offer. And I can build enough to demonstrate feasibility—then drive adoption across the organization."

**Proof points (see profile.md for full detail):**

| Category | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Systems impact | 60% appointment increase, 70% manual handling reduction, 4-system integration |
| Scale | $2.4M media budget, 27 locations, $100M+ portfolio |
| AI credentials | Oxford AI Governance, HIPAA compliance, NIST AI RMF |
| Data/Analytics | M.S. coursework, BigQuery/GCP, ML (PyCaret, H2O, XGBoost) |
| Consulting | Active practice, 20K+ lead scoring system, $30K client launch |

## Framing Principles

### Lead with Outcomes

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I built an automation system" | "I reduced lead response time from 24 hours to 15 minutes" |
| "I implemented personalization" | "60% increase in booked appointments through intelligent routing" |

### Lead with Patterns

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "$100M+ revenue portfolio" | "Multi-location operations across retail and hospitality" |
| "CRM implementation" | "Marketing technology architecture for distributed operations" |

### Make Change Management Visible

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I built the system" | "I built the system and drove adoption across 50 locations" |
| Technical description only | Technical + "how we got teams to use it" |

### Platform Signal

| De-emphasize | Emphasize |
|--------------|-----------|
| "Go High Level" | "Marketing automation architecture" |
| Tool-specific details | Integration patterns, data architecture |
| SMB scale | Enterprise complexity (locations, volume, compliance) |

---

## Quick Reference: Language

**Use:**

- "I solved X for a company like yours"
- "Here's what the research says about [domain]"
- "Built and deployed"
- "Drove adoption across [scope]"
- "Platform architecture on AWS/Azure/GCP"
- "I work the intersections"

**Avoid:**

- Tool names that signal SMB (Go High Level → "marketing automation architecture")
- "I'm on a journey" → "I solved this problem"
- Framework explanations → proof through implementation

---

## Domain Positioning

### Multi-Location Operations (Career Pattern)

| Role | Domain | Scale |
|------|--------|-------|
| Marketing Director | Hospitality | 7 locations |
| AI Systems Manager | PE-backed retail | 50 locations, $100M+ |

**Why this matters:** Ford (dealer networks), Deloitte (retail/hospitality verticals), any enterprise (franchise-like complexity, distributed adoption).

### Domains Researched (WKM)

Legal AI, Finance AI, Healthcare AI, Manufacturing AI, Retail ML

---

## Platform Emphasis

**Enterprise signals:**

- Azure AI services (OpenAI, Document Intelligence, AI Search)
- GCP (BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Looker Studio)
- AWS (certification in progress)
- M365 / Copilot ecosystem
- CRM architecture (platform-agnostic framing)

**SMB signals to avoid:**

- Go High Level by name
- Tool-specific tutorials
- SMB-scale examples without enterprise framing
