# Content Strategy

What themes to explore and how to frame them—bridging positioning, audience, and content architecture.

## Problems Worth Talking About

Topics that resonate with the target audience and align with positioning:

- Why enterprise AI adoption stalls at vendor integration
- The trust-building progression from analytics to automation
- How regulatory burden shapes deployment timelines across industries
- The gap between vendor AI promises and implementation reality
- How mid-market can access enterprise-grade AI at accessible cost

---

## What Audiences Actually Want

### Fortune 1000 AI Transformation Manager

- Vendor ecosystem knowledge (M365 + Copilot, Salesforce + Einstein)
- Adoption playbooks with metrics
- Stakeholder management experience
- Evidence of driving organizational change

### Mid-Market CEO/COO

- "I did X for a company like yours, resulted in Y"
- Fast time-to-value
- Specific industry understanding
- Technical capability without needing to hire a team

## The Strategic Pivot

**Don't abandon AI-native identity. Demonstrate it through domain-relevant implementation rather than explain it through frameworks.**

| Instead of | Do this |
|------------|---------|
| "Here's what AI-native means" (framework) | "Here's what I built for a retail client" (proof) |
| "Three Horizons explain transformation" (theory) | "Here's how I helped a team adopt Copilot" (story) |
| "Capability loading is real" (concept) | "I loaded manufacturing scheduling optimization" (evidence) |
| "I'm on a journey" (process) | "I solved this problem" (outcome) |

## Framing Principles

### Scale Signal

Multi-location operations is a career pattern, not one job. Use it.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "$100M+ revenue portfolio" | "Multi-location operations across retail and hospitality" |
| One job's metrics | Career pattern: 7 locations (hospitality) → 50 locations (retail) |
| "CRM implementation" | "Marketing technology architecture for distributed operations" |

### Platform Signal

De-emphasize SMB tools. Emphasize enterprise platforms.

| De-emphasize | Emphasize |
|--------------|-----------|
| "Go High Level" | "Marketing automation architecture" |
| Tool-specific details | Integration patterns, data architecture |
| SMB scale | Enterprise complexity (locations, volume, compliance) |

### Outcome Signal

Lead with business outcomes, not technology.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I built an automation system" | "I reduced lead response time from 24 hours to 15 minutes" |
| "I implemented personalization" | "I enabled location-specific campaigns that increased conversion by X%" |

### Change Management Signal

This is the throughline. Make it visible.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I built the system" | "I built the system and drove adoption across 50 locations" |
| Technical description only | Technical + "how we got teams to use it" |
