# Language Reframing Guide

The AI Ops Language Map: From SMB to Enterprise. The goal is to move from implementation details to architectural value.

---

## 1. Identity & Role Reframing

The shift from "The Guy Who Builds Tools" to "The Leader Who Architects Systems."

| Avoid (SMB/Freelance) | Use (Enterprise/Advisory) | Rationale |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Freelancer / Solopreneur | Principal Consultant / Systems Architect | Signals ownership and executive-level authority |
| Digital Marketer | AI-Native Operations Leader | Positions you as a builder of infrastructure, not just a runner of ads |
| I'm on a journey | I solved this specific problem | Replaces "process" with "proven outcome" |
| Marketing Agency owner | Founder, Three Horizons LLC | Provides a professional legal framework for engagements |

---

## 2. Operational & Systems Language

Moving away from specific tools toward integration patterns and business outcomes.

| Avoid (Technical/SMB) | Use (Strategic/Enterprise) | Strategic Signal |
|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Go High Level (GHL) | Distributed CRM Architecture | De-emphasizes the tool; emphasizes multi-location complexity |
| Built a ticketing system | Enterprise Workflow Transformation | Reframes a "task" as a fundamental shift in how work flows |
| Automated some emails | Automated Journey Orchestration | Signals sophisticated, multi-channel customer lifecycle management |
| Integrating apps via Zapier | API-First Middleware & Orchestration | Sounds like robust engineering rather than a "no-code" hack |
| Reduced manual work | 70% Reduction in Manual Handling | Uses "industrial" terms common in Six Sigma and Lean environments |

---

## 3. Data & Intelligence Language

Translating "Python scripts" into "Strategic Decision Support."

| Avoid (Technical/SMB) | Use (Strategic/Enterprise) | Strategic Signal |
|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Python script / Pipeline | Automated Intelligence Infrastructure | Shows that the code serves a larger business purpose |
| Churn / RFM model | Predictive Customer Equity Mapping | Connects data science directly to the financial health of the business |
| Lead scoring | Algorithmic Resource Allocation | Shows you are optimizing where the company spends its time and money |
| Jupyter Notebooks | Reproducible Audit Trails | Signals governance and professional standards for data integrity |
| Market Basket Analysis | Cross-Sell Infrastructure & Revenue Optimization | Replaces "academic term" with "business outcome" |

---

## 4. Scale & Complexity Language

Explicitly signaling experience with distributed, high-volume environments.

| Avoid (Small Scale) | Use (Enterprise Scale) | Source of Truth |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Small business clients | Mid-market & Multi-location Enterprises | Matches the complexity of target roles (e.g., Ford, Deloitte) |
| Lead generation | Revenue Operations (RevOps) | A modern enterprise term for the intersection of sales, marketing, and systems |
| Improving conversion | Yield Optimization | Uses the language of Finance and Operations Managers |
| 10-20 clients | $100M+ Portfolio Management | Leads with the financial weight of your responsibility |
| 7 or 50 locations | Distributed Operations Architecture | Highlights ability to drive adoption across a spread-out team |

---

## 5. The "Throughline": Change Management

This is the differentiator. Make it visible in every project.

Instead of saying "I built the system," use these frames:

- "Drove adoption across [X] locations"
- "Bridged the strategy-to-execution gap"
- "Established the Three Lines of Defence for AI Governance"
- "Guided organizational transition to AI-native workflows"

---

## Quick Reference: Weak vs. Strong

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I built an automation system." | "I reduced lead response time from 24 hours to 15 minutes through intelligent routing." |
| "I implemented personalization." | "I achieved a 60% increase in booked appointments by architecting a location-specific campaign strategy." |
