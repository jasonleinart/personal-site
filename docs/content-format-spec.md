# Content Format Spec

Guidelines for longer-form content (playbook phases, analysis articles) to maintain readability and avoid walls of text or bullet-point dumps.

---

## Core Principle

**Vary format within sections, not just between them.** Each subsection should use a different structural approach to keep the reader engaged.

---

## Format Elements

### Tables
- Use for **comparisons, dimensions, or structured data**
- Keep short: 3-4 rows ideal, 5 max
- Strong first column (bold labels)
- Don't use for narrative content

### Bullet Lists
- Use for **parallel items** (things of the same type)
- 3-5 items max
- Keep items short (one line if possible)
- Don't use for sequential content

### Numbered Lists
- Use for **sequences, outputs, or steps**
- Bold label + em-dash + description format works well
- Example: `1. **Current-state documentation** — How things actually work today`

### Prose Paragraphs
- Use for **narrative, context, and examples**
- Vary sentence length within paragraphs
- End sections with short punchy sentences
- Include specific examples with names and numbers

### Bold Callout Quotes
- Use to **break up prose and highlight key phrases**
- Example: `I flip this by asking: **"What did you actually do yesterday?"**`

### Contrast Structure
- Set up the standard/expected approach
- Then show your approach
- Example: "The standard question produces X. I flip this by asking Y."

## Section Patterns

### Opening a Section
- Start with a punchy statement or provocative claim
- Follow with a personal experience or specific example
- Don't start with a list or table

### Closing a Section
- End with a short, punchy sentence
- Or a specific insight that lands the point
- Don't trail off with bullets

### Subsection Variety
Within a major section (like "The Methodology"), vary the structure across subsections:

| Subsection | Example Structure |
|------------|-------------------|
| First | Contrast setup → Bold quote → Short bullet list → Story with numbers |
| Second | Short opener → Bullet list → One-sentence closer |
| Third | Rhetorical questions → Specific story → Insight sentence |
| Fourth | Statement → Small table → Formula paragraphs |

Don't repeat the same structure in adjacent subsections.

## Specific Numbers

Sprinkle specific numbers throughout to add credibility:
- Time: "45-minute conversations", "3 hours every Monday", "20 minutes arguing"
- Quantities: "6-10 people", "2-3 common paths"
- Percentages: "40% of someone's time", "89% of cases"
- Costs: "$247,000 annually", "$51,000/year in labor"

Vague statements like "significant time savings" fail. Specific numbers stick.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Wall of text**
- More than 3 paragraphs in a row without a structural break
- Fix: Insert a table, list, or bold callout

**Bullet dump**
- More than 5 bullets in a list
- Multiple bullet lists in sequence
- Fix: Convert some to prose, use a table, or split into subsections

**Monotonous structure**
- Every subsection follows the same format
- Fix: Deliberately vary (see Subsection Variety above)

**Skeletal bullets**
- Lists with no surrounding context
- Fix: Add intro paragraph before, insight sentence after

**Missing specifics**
- Generic statements without examples or numbers
- Fix: Add a story, name a number, give a concrete case

---

## Voice Reminders

- Use "I" not "we" (personal site)
- Include personal experience: "I've seen...", "I watched a team..."
- Use "you" to address the reader directly where appropriate
- Follow anti-AI writing patterns (see `Workspace/writing/universal/anti-ai-patterns.md`)

## Quick Checklist

Before publishing longer-form content:

1. Does each major section start with prose (not a list)?
2. Are tables kept to 3-4 rows?
3. Are bullet lists 5 items or fewer?
4. Do adjacent subsections use different structures?
5. Are there specific numbers (times, quantities, costs)?
6. Does each section end with a punchy closer?
7. Is there at least one specific story or example per major section?
